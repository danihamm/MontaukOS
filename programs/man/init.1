.TH INIT 1
.SH NAME
    init - MontaukOS init system

.SH SYNOPSIS
    Spawned automatically by the kernel as PID 0.

.SH DESCRIPTION
    init is the first userspace process started by the MontaukOS
    kernel. It chains system services in sequence, then launches
    the interactive shell.

    Each service is spawned as a child process. init waits for it
    to exit before starting the next one. If a service fails to
    spawn, init logs an error and continues to the next stage.

    Log output is timestamped and color-coded:

        HH:MM:SS   INFO   init  Starting dhcp
        HH:MM:SS     OK   init  dhcp finished (pid 1)

.SH BOOT SEQUENCE
    The following services are started in order:

        1. 0:/os/dhcp.elf     Obtain network configuration via DHCP
        2. 0:/os/shell.elf    Launch the interactive shell

    After the shell exits, init enters an idle loop.

.SH LOG LEVELS
    init uses four log levels, each with a distinct color:

        OK      Green    Service completed successfully
        INFO    Cyan     Informational (service starting, etc.)
        WARN    Yellow   Non-fatal warning
        FAIL    Red      Service failed to start

.SH SEE ALSO
    dhcp(1), shell(1), syscalls(2)
